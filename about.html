          <strong> Hi! My name is Steph, nice to meet you!</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          You've found your way to my "about" page, so you probably want to know
          some stuff about me, huh? <br />
          <br />
          Let's start with the basics: <br />
          My full name is Stephanie Zbinden. <br />
          I was born in 1992 and live in Switzerland. <br />
          I live on a small dairy farm with my parents and grandma. It's pretty
          swell.
          <br />
          <br />
          My hobbies include playing video games, playing D&D, writing, drawing,
          playing steeldrum, listening to music, listening to 2-hour YouTube
          essays (preferrably while playing video games), spending time with my
          cat, learning new skills, regular stuff like that. <br />
          Oh! And I've started dabbling in AI Art and growing plants.<br />
          And learning how to code - you can see the results of that with your
          own eyes right now! How neat is that?
          <br />
          <br />
          Hmm, what else... <br />

          Since I love learning, the list of hobbies is only going to grow over
          time - in fact, I've already set my sights on some things to do after
          finishing my current coding endeavour. <br />
          Having spent pretty much all my working days in an office, I'm rather
          interested in data science and I think that's going to be my next big
          thing I want to work on. And getting into back-end developing, going
          full-stack. <br />
          And I want to get back into becoming a game designer, I've been
          wanting to do that for years and after some failed attempts at
          obtaining a spot at a university for it, I took a step back. But I
          will get there!
          <br />
          <br />
          I think that's about it right now. <br />
          Thank you for checking out my page! I hope you have a great day~
        </p>
